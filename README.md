NK Codesüíõ - Netflix Landing Page Clone
## Description 

I have built a Netflix landing page clone with HTML and CSS. It closely resembles the original Netflix design and layout, featuring a responsive header, sections showcasing key features, FAQs, and a footer. The clone is built using modern web development techniques and can serve as a starting point for building similar websites.

**Your star‚≠ê for the repositories is appreciated!**

## Getting Started with Netflix Landing Page Clone

To create a Netflix landing page clone, follow these steps:

1. Obtain the Required Assets:

    
    --Open the `requirements.txt` file provided.
    
    --Inside the file, you will find the background image and icons required for all the sections.
    
    --Download and save these assets to your local machine.

2. Set Up the Project:

    
    --Create a new directory for your project.
    
    --Open your preferred code editor and navigate to the project directory.
    
    --Initialize a new HTML file, CSS file, and any additional JavaScript files as needed.

3. Build the Layout:

    
    --Use the downloaded background image and icons as required for each section of the landing page.
    
    --Use HTML and CSS to create the header, sections, FAQs, and footer that closely resemble the original Netflix design.
    
    --Ensure the page is responsive and works well on different devices.

4. Implement Functionality:

    
    --Add interactive elements such as sign-up and sign-in buttons.
    
    --Create navigation links to different sections of the landing page.
    
    --Incorporate any desired animations or transitions using CSS or JavaScript.

5. Customize the Clone:

    
    --To avoid copyright infringement, make substantial changes to the code and design to differentiate it from the original Netflix page.
    
    --Experiment with different colors, fonts, layouts, and additional features to give the clone a unique touch.

6. Test and Review:

    
    --Test the landing page clone on different browsers and devices to ensure it functions correctly and displays properly.
    
    --Review the code for any errors, bugs, or inconsistencies.
    
    --Make necessary adjustments to improve the overall user experience.

Remember that while building a clone, it's crucial to maintain the originality of your work. Making significant changes to the code and design will help distinguish your clone from the actual Netflix landing page, reducing the risk of legal issues.
